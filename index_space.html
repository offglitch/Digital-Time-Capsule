            <div class="line"></div>
            <p>After two decades of research for top scouting recruits, we are happy to announce that A-3693 has been approved and selected to join the class of 2020.</p>
            <p>During our investigations regarding this individual, we were able to identify an array of Standardized Universal Law
                (<a id="sul" href="https://imgur.com/r/aww">S.U.L.</a>)
                unique traits within them early on in their life
            </p>
            <p>Due to their age, mental, and physical wellbeing, <mark class="space1">Space Corp.</mark>decided to allow this individual time to fully develop these traits without galactic interferences.</p>
            <p>Within the span of four years, we noticed this individual’s digital presence slowly fading away. It was only after they have disappeared from the Intergalactic Web that we got alarmed and made it a priority to locate them.</p>
            <p>Thankfully, the individual resurfaced on the Intergalactic Web and we were able to trace some of their data for locating purposes. Scouting recruits at <mark class="space1">Space Corp.</mark>are hand selected, and are all unique human beings with very specific S.U.L. traits. These skills are not inherent within humans, and therefore, gaining them at a relatively young age is an uncommon phenomena that alerts us to locate, train and recruit such individuals.</p>

            <p>Human A-3693, on multiple occasions, exhibited abilities that go well beyond the average human’s sensory capabilities, along with extraordinary awareness and adaptability skills.
            </p>
            <p>They are capable of combining both brain hemispheres, allowing them to examine situations from various perspectives, navigate linguistics seamlessly, and digest data at high rates.
            </p>
            <p> A lot of these traits can be attributed to this individual’s resourcefulness in overcoming the human test; they forcefully exposed themselves to the truth of the universe and preserved, regardless of how many times they were presented with cheat codes.</p>
