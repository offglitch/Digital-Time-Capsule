# Digital Time Capsule

*__How does our digital presence represent us? Is it an accurate portrayal of who we are? What does our
data reflect and/or leave out about ourselves? If an extraterrestrial being could only know us through our
digital life, how accurate would their understanding be?__*

I have always been curious to how our digital presence shapes a lot of what people percieve of us in real life.
In an effort to understand this, I ventured out to create a digital time capsule of myself through a report by a space agency called __*Space Corporation*__.
